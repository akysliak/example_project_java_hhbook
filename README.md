This repository contains my programming examples in Java. 

The code was created in 2015 in course of my work on a Java programming project in a team of 3 people
at the Leibniz-Universit√§t Hannover. The final application represented a household book which allowed 
to create diverse user profiles, add already performed and planned for the future transactions, calculate
current and expected (after future transactions are executed) balance, produce diagrams, store the user
profile with its transaction history in a file and read it from there. The implementation followed the
OOP principles.

The files in this folder represent some of the basic casses within the application:

+ **UserProfile** - hu

+ **Transaction** -- nj 

+ **Editor** -- nj
